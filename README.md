# Benchmark Deep Learning

Previous papers on benchmarking deep neural networks offer knowledge of deep learning hardware devices and software frameworks. This paper introduces benchmarking principles, surveys machine learning devices including GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, and reviews deep learning software frameworks. It also qualitatively compares these technologies with respect to benchmarking from the angles of our 7-metric approach to deep learning frameworks and 12-metric approach to machine learning hardware platforms. 

After reading the paper, the audience will understand seven benchmarking principles, generally know that differential characteristics of mainstream artificial intelligence devices,  qualitatively compare deep learning hardware through the 12-metric approach for benchmarking neural network hardware, and read benchmarking results of 16 deep learning frameworks via our 7-metric set for benchmarking  frameworks.
